# Mars---Task-1

By doing this task i have learnt how to use an arduino , how to give connections to all the components and how to code into the arduino using c++ , all from scratch . 
it was an amazing experience for me since i always had ideas in my mind but never knew how such things work . Now i feel confident about how to use them and make them work !!.
my first project is on intruder dectection system 
second is on automatic plant watering system 
and third is on Fire Detection system .

1) I learnt the basics of arduino microcontroller
2) Then I went through the basics of tinkerCAD .
3) After which I read about the sensors listed .
4) after which I made up three ideas and started working on it.

Project 1):
project 1 is about "Intruder Detection System" 
->The PIR sensor is ude to detect motion
->The Ultrasonic Sensor is used to measure the distance at which the intruder is standing from the door.

The buzzer goes on if - The distance between intruder and door is less than 50 and motion is detected.

Project 2):
project 2 is about "Automatic PLant Watering System"
->The soil moisture sensor used measures the moisture level in the soil .
->The temperature sensor used measures the outside temperature. 

A servo is used to adjust the opening angles corresponding to the respective moisture and temperature levels.

1)If the moisture level is less than 30 and temperature level is greater than 35 
   -> the servo opens up to 180 degrees (max water flow)

2)If the moisture level is greater than 30 and temperature is greater than 35 degrees
   -> The servo opens up to 90 degrees(medium level flow)

3)If the moisture level is less than 30 and temperature is less than 35 degrees 
   ->The servo opens up to 45 degrees(slight water flow)

4)If the moisture level is greater than 30 and temperature is less than 35 degrees 
   ->The servo remains at 0 degrees(no water flow)


Project 3):
project 3 is about "Fire detection system"
-> Gas sensor is used to detect gas or smoke.
-> Temperature sensor is used to measure the temperature.

If temperature is above 50 degrees and gas is detected , then the alarm goes on and an LED is used to alert the people.
