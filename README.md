# Mars---Task-1

By doing this task i have learnt how to use an arduino , how to give connections to all the components and how to code into the arduino using c++ , all from scratch . 
it was an amazing experience for me since i always had ideas in my mind but never knew how such things work . Now i feel confident about how to use them and make them work !!.
my first project is on intruder dectection system 
second is on automatic plant watering system 
and third is on Fire Detection system .

1) I learnt the basics of arduino microcontroller
2) Then I went through the basics of tinkerCAD .
3) After which I read about the sensors listed .
